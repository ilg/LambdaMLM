# LambdaMLM

A mailing list manager (MLM or email discussion list software) that runs on AWS Lambda (with help from SES and S3).

***This is rapidly approaching very basic usability, but it isn't there yet.***

## Goals

### Setup/Development/Deployment via Fabric

- [ ] Command to perform initial AWS setup.
- [x] Command to re-deploy Lambda code.
- [x] Command to set up virtualenv (in .env) based on requirements.txt.

### Command and Control

- [x] Receive commands via a command user at any domain.
- [x] Reply to unsigned commands with signed version to avoid running commands from spoofed emails.
- [x] Process commands like *nix CLI commands.
- [x] Accept single command in subject.
- [ ] Accept multiple commands in body.
- [x] Maintain list configurations in S3 in YAML format

#### Commands

- [ ] Create list
- [x] Configure list
- [x] Subscribe to list
- [x] Unsubscribe from list
- [x] Toggle modes: vacation, echo-post, etc.
- [ ] Moderation

### Sending/Receiving Email

- [x] Validate incoming email against posting permissions
- [ ] Modify message per list configuration:
	- [x] Tag subject
	- [x] Reply to list
	- [ ] Message footer
- [x] Send email to list members
- [ ] Handle bounces
	- [x] Variable envelope return path
	- [x] Stop sending emails to addresses that continue to bounce
	- [ ] Differentiate between hard and soft bounces
	- [ ] Notify list member and/or list admin about bounces
- [ ] Handle moderating messages
- [ ] Handle MIME/attachments

## Notes

- 2016-02-04: Sending via Amazon SES is likely not possible, as SES appears to require that the `From:` address be verified, which isn't plausible for discussion lists.  The best option thus far is to use an external SMTP server.  It appears to be possible to configure a given host to receive email through SES and send via an external SMTP server with both SPF and DKIM passing.
- 2016-02-06: Setting a list name with non-ASCII characters with `reply-to-list: true` generates `Reply-to:` headers that may not be entirely correctâ€”GMail ignores them entirely and other mail clients show weird things.

## Commands

A single command is sent as the subject of an email to `lambda@[domain]` where `domain` is a domain on which LambdaMLM receives email.  LambdaMLM will reply with a signed version of the command, in order to validate the address from which the command came.  The command is confirmed and executed by replying to that email.

- `about` returns an about message
- `echo [parameters]` echos the given parameters
- `list [list address]` indicates a list-specific command
	- _User-level commands:_
		- `subscribe` subscribes the sender to the list
		- `unsubscribe` removes the sender from the list
		- `setflag [flag name]` sets the given flag on the sender
		- `unsetflag [flag name]` unsets the given flag on the sender
	- _Admin commands:_
		- `create` creates the list
		- `members` returns a list of the members
		- `config` returns the list configuration
		- `set [config option name] [value]` sets the value of a configuration option for the list
			- value is assumed to be a string
			- for boolean values, use `--true` or `--false`
			- for integer values, use `--int [value]`
		- `subscribe [address]` subscribes the given address to the list
		- `unsubscribe [address]` removes the given address from the list
		- `setflag [flag name] [address]` sets the given flag on the member with the given address
		- `unsetflag [flag name] [address]` unsets the given flag on the member with the given address

## List Configuration File Format

### Top-level properties

- `members` The list of members.

###### Potential Future Flags

Based on [ecartis](https://www.ecartis.net), descriptions from [here](https://wiki.utdallas.edu/wiki/display/FAQ/Ecartis+Account+Flags).

- `digest` User wants to receive digested version of list.
- `digest2` User wants to receive digested version of list _and_ normal posts. This flag should be set _instead_ of `digest`, not in addition to.
- `diagnostic` User is for diagnostics only, don't receive list traffic.

- `reports` User wishes to have reports sent to them.
- `ackPost` User receives small note when a message is posted, or approved by a moderator.
- `hidden` User won't show up in membership listing of list unless viewed by an admin.

- !Member
  address: admin@example.com
