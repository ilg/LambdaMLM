# LambdaMLM

A mailing list manager (MLM or email discussion list software) that runs on AWS Lambda (with help from SES and S3).

***LambdaMLM is not production-ready.  Use LambdaMLM at your own risk.***

Planned enhancements, bugs, and known limitations are tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ilg/LambdaMLM/issues).

Setup requires familiarity with AWSâ€”in particular, having credentials already set up locally and having familiarity with SES, IAM, and Lambda will help.  A rough outline of how to set up LambdaMLM is [here](docs/setup.md).
